This is a replacement buildsystem for Python.  The existing (autotools based)
buildsystem for Python is overcomplicated and makes cross-compiling very
difficult.

This cmake-based buildsystem is better because:

  * It's much faster to compile: 7 seconds instead of 58 seconds in my
    unscientific test.
  * No compiled program for the target architecture is used in the build
    itself.  This makes cross-compiling possible.
  * Same project files for all platforms - there's no need to maintain the
    unix build separately from four different MSVC builds.

How to use this buildsystem:
  
  * Download and extract the Python 2.7.1 source.
  * Copy all the files in this repository into the Python source directory.
  * cd bin
  * cmake ..
  * make -j10
  * sudo make install

Note: This branch is for Python version 2.7.1.  Since this buildsystem is
maintained separately from Python itself it needs to be manually updated
whenever there is a new release of Python.
